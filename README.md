Music Playlist Manager is a Java desktop application that allows users to create and manage playlists of their favorite MP3 songs. Users can easily add songs by selecting them from their file system, view details like title and artist, and save their playlists as text files. The application uses the Swing library for its user interface and relies on mp3agic and jaudiotagger to read song metadata and manage audio files. To get started, clone the repository, add the required libraries, and run the application to organize your music collection effortlessly
